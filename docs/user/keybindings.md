# Keybindings

Customize shortcuts in **Settings → Keybindings** on web and desktop. That page
also lists the command IDs and defaults available in your version.

## Edit the configuration file

Keybindings live on the environment's machine, in
`~/.t3/userdata/keybindings.json` by default. You can edit this file directly.
It is a JSON array of rules:

```json
[
  { "key": "mod+g", "command": "terminal.toggle" },
  { "key": "mod+shift+g", "command": "terminal.new", "when": "terminalFocus" }
]
```

T3 Code creates the file with its defaults and adds new defaults on later startups.
New defaults do not replace commands you customized. If a new default overlaps one
of your shortcuts, [rule order](#precedence) decides which runs.
Invalid rules are ignored; if the file cannot be parsed, T3 Code uses defaults.

## Rule shape

Each rule requires a `key` shortcut and a `command` ID. An optional `when`
expression restricts when it runs.

Project scripts use `script.{id}.run`, such as `script.test.run`.

## Key syntax

Join modifiers and a key with `+`, such as `mod+shift+d` or `ctrl+l`.
`mod` means Command on macOS and Control elsewhere. Other modifiers are
`cmd` / `meta`, `ctrl` / `control`, `alt` / `option`, and `shift`.

## When conditions

Commands are IDs like `terminal.toggle`, `commandPalette.toggle`, `preview.refresh`, and
`chat.new`. Project scripts are addressable as `script.{id}.run`, for example `script.test.run`.
`chat.newInWorktree` creates another conversation in the current checkout.

`thread.stop` interrupts the active turn when the current thread is running. It is unassigned by
default, so add your preferred shortcut in Settings or `keybindings.json`.

`filePicker.toggle` opens file search for the active project and defaults to `mod+p`.
`projectSearch.toggle` searches inside the active project's files and defaults to `mod+shift+f`.
Repeating either shortcut closes that search, and switching shortcuts replaces the open search.
`usage.open` opens the Usage page and defaults to `mod+u`. It does not run while the terminal has
focus.
`themeEditor.toggle` opens or closes the floating theme editor and defaults to
`mod+alt+shift+t`. Select a color label to spotlight the elements that use it; select the label
again to clear the spotlight. The swatch and hex field keep that color selected while you edit it.
Advanced mode groups related app tokens into a smaller set of color families. Changing a family
updates its paired text and interaction states while leaving every unrelated imported color intact.
Use **Inspect** to pick an element in the app and reveal its color token. Inspect disarms after one
successful pick; its hover glow and badge preview the element and color family that click will select.
**Cancel** or `Escape` exits Inspect and clears its selection and spotlight.

Available context keys are `terminalFocus`, `terminalOpen`, `previewFocus`,
`previewOpen`, and `modelPickerOpen`. Unknown keys evaluate to `false`.

Combine keys with `!` for not, `&&` for and, `||` for or, and parentheses:

```json
{ "key": "mod+j", "command": "terminal.toggle", "when": "terminalOpen && !terminalFocus" }
```

## Precedence

The last rule whose key and condition both match wins, even if it belongs to a
different command. Put a more specific rule after a general one when they share
a shortcut.

## Commands with special behavior

`chat.new` may ask you to choose a project when there is more than one.
`chat.newLocal` skips that chooser. Both use your
[new-thread defaults](./thread-sidebar.md#start-a-thread).

## Reserved shortcuts

In the desktop app, `mod+w` closes the focused terminal or the active right-panel
tab. When nothing remains to close, it closes the window. In a browser, `mod+w`
closes the browser tab; rebind `rightPanel.close` and `terminal.close` to an available
shortcut such as `alt+w`.

Many defaults include `!terminalFocus` so they do not intercept terminal input.
Keep that condition when remapping them if you want the same behavior.

## Desktop quit shortcut

Use `Cmd+Q` on macOS or `Ctrl+Q` on Windows and Linux. In the default **Hold** mode,
hold for 1.2 seconds or press twice within 500 milliseconds. Holding requires
keyboard repeat; if repeat is disabled, use two presses or the application menu.

Change **Settings → General → Confirmations → Quit shortcut** to **Direct** for a
single press or **Double press** for two presses only. Choosing **Quit** from the
application menu always quits immediately.
